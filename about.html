                    <div class="dash"></div>
                    <p>The University of Ghana Hospital, also known as Legon Hospital, was established in 1957 to cater for the health
                       needs of the university community. Over time, it has grown to become a quasi-government hospital with a bed 
                       capacity of 130 and various facilities including General Wards, Maternity Wing, Casualty and Emergency Ward, 
                       Pediatric Unit, Dental Unit, and Operating Theatre. The hospital now serves as a District Hospital with a wide 
                       catchment area and offers specialist consultancy services, reducing the need for referrals to Korle-Bu and 37 Hospital. 
                       The hospital also runs a Primary Health Care outreach program to teach and advise the general public on 
                       various health-related issues..</p>
